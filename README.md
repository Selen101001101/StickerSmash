# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# TUTORIAL

## Initialize a new Expo app

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest StickerSmash
```

## Run reset-project script

[reset-project] script resets the app directory structure in a project and copies the previous boilerplate files from the project's root directory to another sub-directory called app-example. We can delete it since it is not part of our main app's structure.

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

## Run the app on mobile and web

```bash
npx expo start
```
After running the app:

- The development server will start, and you'll see a QR code inside the terminal window.
- Scan that QR code to open the app on the device. On Android, use the Expo Go > Scan QR code option. On iOS, use the default camera app.
- To run the web app, press w in the terminal. It will open the web app in the default web browser.

## Edit the index screen

```jsx
import { Text, View,  StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Home screen</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: '#25292e',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    color: '#fff',
  },
});

```

React Native uses the same color format as the web. It supports [hex] [triplets] (this is what #fff is), [rgba], [hsl], and [named] [colors], such as [red], [green], [blue], [peru], and [papayawhip]. For more information, see [Colors in React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors).
